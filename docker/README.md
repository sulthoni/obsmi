To build the Docker environment locally, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal and run the command from this folder:
   `docker-compose up -d --build`

2. Once the containers are running, open a browser and navigate to:
   `http://localhost:3030/#/dataset/colsys/query` \
   _(as the starting point to execute SPARQL queries)_.

3. If prompted for authentication, use the following credentials:\
   `Username: admin`\
   `Password: admin`
