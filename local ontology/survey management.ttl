It extends and complements the Generic Statistical Business Process Model (GSBPM) by adding additional activities needed to support statistical production. The GAMSO describes activities – that is, what statistical organisations do – while the GSBPM describes the process – that is, how statistical organisations undertake the activity of statistical production.

Like the GSBPM, the GAMSO aims to provide a common vocabulary and framework to support international collaboration activities, particularly in the field of modernisation.  While individual collaboration typically focuses on modernising a particular aspect of production (as described by the GSBPM), statistical production occurs within a broader context of corporate strategies, capabilities and support. The GAMSO helps to place collaboration in the wider context."""@en .

For example, how long it took to complete execution of the Process Step and what percentage of records in the Core Input was updated by the Process Step to produce the Core Output. One purpose for a Process Metric may be to provide a quality measure related to the Core Output. For example, a Process Step with the Business Function of imputing missing values is likely to result, as its Core Output, in a Data Set where values that were missing previously have been imputed. Statistical quality measures, captured as Process Metrics for that Process Step may include a measure of how many records were imputed, and a measure of how much difference, statistically, the imputed values make to the dataset overall which can be also used as a part of a quality report associated with the Data Set produced. Another purpose for a Process Metric may be to measure an aspect of the Process Step which is not directly related to the Core Output it produced. For example, a Process Metric may record the time taken to complete the Process Step or other forms of resource utilisation (for example, human and/or IT). Often these two kinds of Process Metrics will be used in combination when seeking to, for example, monitor and tune a statistical Business Process so its statistical outputs achieve the highest level of quality possible based on the time, staff and/or IT resources that are available."@en ;

In GSIM, the information class Register is used to describe both types because the attributes are more or less the same so from the information management point of view, they can be handled as one GSIM class. There is usually a purpose or authority for maintaining the Register and each object in the Register is described using a pre-defined set of characteristics. Examples include business and population registers as used by statistical organisations. Therefore, from statistical perspective, the Register can be interpreted as a set of objects for a given Population, updated on a regular basis, containing information on identification, accessibility of Units and other attributes. The Register contains the current and historical statuses of the Population and the causes, effects and sources of alterations in the Population. In order to better understand how the Register is used in GSIM, the use cases for the different scenarios are explained. These scenarios are:
- Register _as Information Set_ maintained and regularly updated by the statistical organisation.
- Register _as Information Set_ for survey frames/sample frames.
- Register _as Information Set_ for statistical Products.
- Register _as Information Set_ used as direct or auxiliary information for the production of statistics.

It is possible to define a Process Control where the next step in the Process Step that will be executed is a fixed value rather than a \"choice\" between two or more possibilities. Where such a design would be appropriate, this feature allows, for example, initiation of a step in the Process Step representing the GSBPM Process Phase (5) to always lead to initiation of GSBPM sub-process Integrate Data (5.1) as the next step. This allows a process designer to divide a Business Process into logical steps (for example, where each step performs a specific Business Function through re-use of a Business Service) even if these process steps will always follow each other in the same order. In all cases, the Process Control Design defines and the Process Control manages the flow between Process Steps, even where the flow is \"trivial\".

It logically takes place at the end of the instance of the process, but relies on inputs gathered throughout the different phases. It includes evaluating the success of a specific instance of the statistical business process, drawing on a range of quantitative and qualitative inputs, and identifying and prioritising potential improvements.
For statistical outputs produced regularly, evaluation should, at least in theory occur for each iteration, determining whether future iterations should take place, and if so, whether any improvements should be implemented. However, in some cases, particularly for regular and well established statistical business processes, evaluation may not be formally carried out for each iteration. In such cases, this phase can be seen as providing the decision as to whether the next iteration should start from the Specify Needs phase, or from some later phase (often the Collect phase).
This phase is made up of three sub-processes, which are generally sequential, from left to right, but which can overlap to some extent in practice. These sub-processes are:
